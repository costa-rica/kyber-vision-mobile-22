## Development Notes

- All timestamps are stored as SQLite DATE types and can include time components
- File uploads use multer middleware for handling multipart form data
- Authentication uses JWT tokens with configurable expiration
- Database operations use Sequelize ORM with TypeScript definitions
- Background jobs are queued for video processing and YouTube uploads
- Email notifications are sent for user registration and video processing completion
